Why?
@snapend
@snap[midopint span-100 text-center font-montserrat text-black text-08]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
**Why do we need Augmented Analytics, though?**
<p>&nbsp;</p>Well, many organizations have already been using (or, have implemented) analytic solutions - however, the general experience of going from **raw data to actionable insights** is a long-drawn-out, **time-consuming process** and, in order to reach the goal, one has to go through a **series** of **complex, manual steps** that has the potential to be **biased** or **error-prone** which is a challenge.

##### What skills are needed to build this capability?
@snapend
@snap[east span-68 text-black text-left font-montserrat text-05]
To support the emerging paradigm, more new roles focused around data and AI are to be considered and it is critical to put in place a formal upskilling program to retrain and enhance the skills of existing people who can leverage augmented analytics capabilities, to meet the growing demand... Some of the key roles that need to be looked at are:<p><p>
- **Data engineers**: A role with a main focus on curating data for further consumption<p>
- **Citizen data scientists**: An emerging role to help fill the skills gap (between a business analyst and data scientist)<p>
- **Developer data scientists**: A role with siginificant development effort focused on building ML and AI models to embed into applications
