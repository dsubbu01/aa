What is (and is not) Augmented Analytics?
@snapend

@snap[south span-90 text-center font-montserrat text-black text-08]
Augmented Analytics is a new approach to problem solving that uses **artificial intelligence**, **data science**, and **machine learning** to **automate data preparation** and **discovery**, with the goal of **producing unbiased** and **optimized recommendations**<p><p>It **supports humans** in the **decision-making process**, and does not replace them

@snap[north span-90 text-center text-white text-14]
Why do we need it, though?
@snapend

@snap[south span-100 text-center font-montserrat text-black text-07]
Well, many organizations have been using or have implemented analytic solutions already - however, the general experience of going from **raw data to actionable insights** is a long-drawn-out, **time-consuming process** and, in order to reach the goal, one has to go through a **series** of **complex, manual steps** that has the potential to be **biased** or **error-prone** which is a challenge. Augmented Analytics could be well positined to address this challenge through automation...

Challenges...
@snapend

@snap[east span-48 font-montserrat text-05]
- Process of going from **raw data to insights** largely remains **manual** and is extremely **time consuming**<p>
- Business community is **inundated with huge amount of data** and it is only **getting worse**<p>
- **Data complexity** is on the rise<p>
- **Feature engineering** and **selection of relevant features** is typically a **complex task**<p>
- Business users **struggle to identify the key features** that plays critical role to take best actions<p>
- Analytics tools are evolving and are getting relatively easier to use â€“ however, **analytics process is highly manual and prone to bias**<p>
- Extremely **difficult for users to explore every possible combination/ pattern**<p>
- **Shortage** of expert **data scientists**<p>

Augmented Analytics as the solution...
@snapend

@snap[east span-48 font-montserrat text-05]
- Uses **machine-learning** and **artificial intelligence** to **automate data preparation** and **discovery**<p>
- **Accelerates development** through use of machine-learning to automate **data preparation**, **discover insights**, **develop**, **compare**, **score** and **refine models**, and share insights<p>
- **Automates** much of the **time-consuming** and **bias-prone tasks** and reduces the risk of missing key insights<p>
- Enables a **business user** play the role of **citizen data scientist**<p>
- Currently, in the midst of a disruptive wave that is **evolving rapidly**

To support the emerging paradigm, more new roles focused around data and AI are to be considered and it is critical to put in place a formal upskilling program to retrain and enhance the skills of existing people who can leverage augmented analytics capabilities, to meet the growing demand... Some of the key roles that need to be looked at are:<p><p>
- **Data engineers**: A role with a main focus on curating data for further consumption<p>
- **Citizen data scientists**: An emerging role to help fill the skills gap (between a business analyst and data scientist)<p>
- **Developer data scientists**: A role with siginificant development effort focused on building ML and AI models to embed into applications
